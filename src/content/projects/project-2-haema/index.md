Recoverly is a Lost and Found Website, a platform designed to connect individuals who have lost personal belongings with those who may have found them. Users can report lost items, browse found items, and interact to recover their belongings. Developing this website provides practical experience in building full-stack applications, user authentication, file uploads, database management, and API integration.

## Key Features  

1. **User Authentication System**:  
   The website allows users to register, log in, and manage their profile with email/password authentication, along with Google or GitHub login options. User-specific routes ensure privacy and data security.  

2. **Lost & Found Item Management**:  
   Users can report lost or found items by filling out a form with details such as title, description, location, and category. Items can be updated, deleted, and tracked through the "Manage My Items" page.  

3. **Post Recovery Feature**:  
   Users can mark a found item as "recovered" and provide details like recovery location and date. Once an item is marked as recovered, its status is updated in the database.  

4. **Responsive Design**:  
   The website is fully responsive, ensuring an optimized user experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.  

5. **Search and Sorting Functionality**:  
   Users can search for lost or found items by title or location, and items are displayed with the most recent posts first. A "See All" button redirects users to a dedicated Lost & Found Items page.
