The habit loop explains how habits are formed and sustained. It consists of four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward. A cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, and the response delivers a reward. Over time, the reward becomes associated with the cue, making the cycle automatic. This loop continues infinitely, shaping much of our daily behavior.

We can divide the habit loop into two main phases: the **problem phase** and the **solution phase**.

### The Problem Phase

This phase highlights the moment when something feels incomplete or unsatisfying.

* **Cue**: the signal that triggers your brain to start a behavior
* **Craving**: the motivational force that drives you to act

For example, walking into a dark room (cue) makes you want to see (craving).

### The Solution Phase

This phase is about taking action and gaining satisfaction.

* **Response**: the action you take to resolve the craving
* **Reward**: the outcome that satisfies your desire and reinforces the habit

Continuing the example, turning on the light switch (response) results in a bright room (reward).

### Key Idea

The main idea behind the habit loop is that habits exist to solve problems.

* If you encounter something good, you want to obtain it.
* If you face pain or discomfort, you want to relieve it.

This problem-solution cycle explains why habits, once formed, become automatic and self-sustaining.
