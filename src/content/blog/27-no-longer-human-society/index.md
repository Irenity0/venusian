"But seriously, no more fooling around with women. Society is unforgiving."

What does "society" mean, anyhow? The collective plural of "human being"? What is the substance of society? All my life I had though of society as something strong, harsh and intimidating but when Horiki said that, the words "Society is you, isn't it?" were on the tip of my tongue, although, not wanting to anger him, I bit them back.

Society is unforgiving.
-It's not society that's unforgiving, it's you, isn't it?

Do that, and the society will give you a hard time.
-Not society, You will.

Society will ostracize you.
-No, not society. You will do the ostracizing, won't you?

Know thyself- thy horror, grotesquerie, villainy cunning, sorcery!"
