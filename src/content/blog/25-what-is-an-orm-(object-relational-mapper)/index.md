An **ORM (Object-Relational Mapper)** is a tool and programming technique that **connects object-oriented programming (OOP) languages with relational databases**. Instead of writing raw SQL queries, developers can use objects and classes from their application to interact with the database. The ORM automatically translates these operations into SQL and then converts the database results back into objects.

In short, an ORM acts as a **bridge between your code and the database**, making development faster, cleaner, and less error-prone.

## How an ORM Works

1. **Object-Oriented Data Structure**  
    In an OOP language (like Java, Python, or JavaScript), data is represented as objects with properties and methods.
    
2. **Relational Database Structure**  
    Databases store data in **tables, rows, and columns**. For example, a `users` table might have columns like `id`, `name`, and `email`.
    
3. **The Mapping**  
    The ORM links (or “maps”) the database tables to the objects in your program. For example, a `User` class in your code can represent the `users` table in the database.
    
4. **Data Conversion**  
    When you save, update, or fetch data, the ORM converts your object-oriented code into SQL commands. Then it takes the database’s response and turns it back into objects that your program can work with.
    

## Benefits of Using an ORM

- **Simplified Development**  
    You don’t need to write long or complex SQL queries. You can use objects and methods you’re already familiar with.
    
- **Faster Development**  
    Since the ORM handles repetitive database operations, developers can focus more on business logic instead of database details.
    
- **Improved Testability**  
    ORMs support mock or in-memory databases, making it easier to test database interactions without needing a real database connection.
    
- **Enhanced Security**  
    Many ORMs protect against common security issues like **SQL injection**, since they handle query building safely under the hood.

## Examples of ORMs

- **Prisma** – A modern ORM for TypeScript and Node.js.  
- **Hibernate** – A widely used ORM in the Java ecosystem.
- **Mongoose** – Popular for MongoDB in Node.js.
- **Sequelize** – A promise-based ORM for SQL databases in Node.js.
