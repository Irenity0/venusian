**Prisma** is a modern **[[ORM (Object Relational Mapper)]]** for **Node.js and TypeScript** applications. It helps developers interact with databases using clean and type-safe code instead of writing raw SQL queries. Prisma supports databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, and MongoDB.



In short, Prisma makes working with databases **easier, safer, and faster**, especially for JavaScript and TypeScript developers.


## Advantages of Prisma

- **Type-Safe Queries**  
    Prisma generates types automatically based on your database schema. This means you catch errors in your code before running it.
    
- **Auto-Generated Client**  
    Prisma creates a client library for your project, so you can query the database using simple and intuitive code.
    
- **Faster Development**  
    You don’t need to spend time writing SQL queries. Prisma provides an easy-to-use API to handle common database operations.
    
- **Cross-Database Support**  
    Prisma works with multiple databases, making it flexible if you need to switch or scale.
    
- **Improved Productivity**  
    Developers can focus on business logic while Prisma takes care of mapping, queries, and conversions.
    


## How Prisma Works (The Workflow)

1. **Define the Schema**  
    You write your database structure in a `schema.prisma` file. This includes models (like `User`, `Post`, `Product`) with their fields and relationships.
    
2. **Generate Prisma Client**  
    Prisma uses this schema to automatically generate a **Prisma Client** – a library tailored to your database.
    
3. **Use in Code**  
    In your Node.js or TypeScript project, you import Prisma Client and use it to perform database operations. For example:
    
    ```js
    const user = await prisma.user.findMany();
    ```
    
    This replaces raw SQL with clean, readable code.
    
4. **Database Migrations**  
    Prisma provides tools to keep your database structure in sync with your schema through **migrations**.
    

## Example in Action

Instead of writing SQL like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE age > 18;
```

With Prisma, you can write:

```js
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: { age: { gt: 18 } }
});
```

This is easier to read, type-safe, and less error-prone.

Prisma is a **powerful ORM** that combines simplicity with strong developer tools. By turning database operations into clean, type-safe code, it saves time, reduces bugs, and improves productivity for developers working in Node.js and TypeScript.
